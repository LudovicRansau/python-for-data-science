# DataSet Information

The data for the project was accessed from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult ). The data is extracted by Barry Becker using
1994 census database.

The data set includes figures on 32,561 observations and 13 attributes for 42 countries.
The target variable in the data set is income level which shows whether a person earns more
than 50K (K denotes thousands, 50K equals 50,000) per year or not based on a set of
different features. There are 12 features containing information on education, gender,
nationality, marital status, occupation, work classification, gender, race, work hours, capital
loss and capital gain.
